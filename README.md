# Discord_PinBot

Discord bot that copies pinned messages to a different channel (so you don't have a limit on pinned messages)

Provide a .env with the token:

```
TOKEN=*bot token*
```

use the commands:    
  /settings WatchedChannel *channelid* - sets the channel to watch for items being pinned    
  /settings PinsChannel *channelid* - sets the channel to send pinned messages    
  /export_pins - exports all currently pinned items to the pins channel    
  /view_settings - lists current setting values    

Example pinned message:    
<img width="420" height="392" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3143c733-7e1c-48ae-b253-9b0617c68734" />
